    "**So the first days in a new job, I was handed the the clients the previous person in the role had. When going through the list with my manager, he told me of a project that had been on stand by for about a year and a half and that he didn't think it will be done. But he told me to keep the client happy because they had many other projects with other of our businesses units. So I called to present myself and asked to visit, review the project and walkthrough the facilities. Being there, walking through the plant we addressed many doubts and concerns he had on the project and told me that this was the first time in more than a year that anyone from my company visited the plant. Two months later they were giving green light to the project**\n",

Crime in Mexico was a random variable that we were at first not able to forsee and that was slowing our progress. My role was primarily programming controllers and that was done at the office, but the need was for someone to help the field engineers to get back on track. I worked so that the controllers were finished and raised my hand to go and help them, it was a very nice experience as I was able to know them better and a sense of camaradery rose that made working much more fun.**\n",

As part of the engineering team my main role was to program control systems for street lighting circuits, but I saw that many of the projects took very long to be designed, so in my spare time I saw the tools they were using to do it and started working to optimize them. When I finish I presented it to the engineering team which were greatly pleased and started using immediately, the time for designing a new project went from an average of two weeks to just one.**\n",

The keys is constant correct practice. Constant, as talent can only carry you so far, you need to work hard and the harder you work (and study and practice) the easier it becomes to do it. Correct, because practicing incorrecly will only make you be very good at being wrong, that is why you get out of your bubble, your confort zone and listen to what other leaders in the area have achieve and understand their point of view. Being right makes you being fast, as you don't need to second guess or check how and why things are done.**\n",

For that we had a software and hardware which was our solution, what we offered our clients. However I saw that at the end of the day, the client was presented with the data but without a plan or action to do something with it. It depended entirely on the client how to get the best used of the expensive software they bought, and most of the clients didn't have an energy specialist or someone who understood in depth the data provided.**\n",

Their job is quite demanding as nobody remembers them when things work ok, but if not they are subjects to lots of stress. I was asked for an energy efficiency project and the first presentation I had was with the forementioned maintenance manager, he didn't like it because it requested to stop some production lines for a day to install the equipment (understandable), however that was the best option in the long run.

As an example, while working as a consultant, my main evaluation metrics were sales and my yearly quota was of two million dollars. I thought: what if they had asked me for three or four million dollars? Thus, I decided that my personal goal will be three million dollars, that way if I reached my goal automatically would have reached my quota, and if not, I had plenty of room to still meet it. That year I ended with 2.95 million dollars in sales, shy a hundread thousand from my goal but 48% over my quota.**\n",

I manage to get insight of the overall picture of what the project was about and told him that I believe it was very well planned, but that I was sure I could offer something better and that I wanted to show him. I sketched a design of the minimum installation as a proof of concept and talked with the projects team if they were able to work on the weekend (it was a Friday), they agreed and asked the client to go there on Saturday to install our equipment and show him that it worked. He hesitated but agreed, and I along the installations team were working that Saturday on the plant. After seeing it working he told me to give him a fully detailed proposal, which we prepared in a couple of days and delivered it. We won the project.**\n",

Being a small company cash flow had a greater impact and the projects were of performance contracting, they were paid with the savings.

One time while gathering data for a solar project at a farm, I held a presentation to show the benefits of the project to the owner. While I was presenting, the owner said: 'Does the hill nearby have any influence in the calculations?' The hill, a tall hill casted a shadow over parts of the farm at certain times of the day and it wasn't accounted for in the calculations. I stopped to think about it for a second and said: No it isn't, thank you for bringing that up. I finished the presentation and back in the office I corrected the calculations and send them back. That same mail was answered shortly: 'We would like to continue with the project, I had no idea to know if the shadow of the hill was used in the calculations, but acknowledging it wasn't made me realize you were listening and honest.'**\n",

The measurments are done on a nine points matrix drawn under the lamp. After many measurments, we had a database of the type of lamp, power and lux measurements. One time when perforing the measurements, the results came way off, the lamp seemed ok, the luxometer was recently calibrated so we were perplexed. I began measuring the voltage supplied, the datasheet of the lamp and then our database. From the database found out that in fact there was a extremely low probability of having those measurements with that lamp and setup. I found out later that the luxometer was broken. To avoid this situation in the future I developed a small model to show the likelihood of the results that proved useful again when the supplier of the lamps later found out they had mislabeled the power in some of the lamps.**\n",
